                                <p>A <strong>JavaScript engine</strong> is a software component that interprets and executes JavaScript code. It takes the JavaScript code written by developers, processes it, and then runs it within the browser or a server-side environment.</p>

                                        <ol>
                                            <li>The engine takes JavaScript code as input, parses it, compiles it (or interprets it), and executes it to produce the desired behavior.</li>
                                            <li>It handles the <strong>execution of JavaScript code</strong>, manages memory, performs garbage collection, and optimizes the execution speed of the code.</li>

                                            <li><strong>Parsing</strong> The engine first parses the JavaScript code into an intermediate format, like an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).</li>
                                            <li><strong>Compilation</strong> It may convert the code into machine code (just-in-time compilation) for faster execution, or it may interpret it line-by-line.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Execution</strong> The code is executed in the context of the runtime environment (browser, Node.js, etc.), and the engine handles tasks like variable scoping, function execution, and error handling.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>

                                            <li><strong>V8 Engine</strong> (used in Google Chrome and Node.js) Known for its speed and efficiency, V8 compiles JavaScript directly into machine code.</li>

                                <p>A <strong>runtime environment</strong> refers to the environment in which JavaScript code is <strong>executed, providing the necessary tools, APIs, and libraries</strong> for the JavaScript engine to perform its tasks.</p>

                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>JavaScript Engine</strong> As explained above, this is responsible for interpreting and executing JavaScript code.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Web APIs (for Browser)</strong> In browsers, JavaScript code interacts with various <strong>Web APIs</strong> (such as the DOM, Fetch API, Canvas API, etc.), allowing it to manipulate the web page, make network requests, and perform other tasks.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Event Loop and Call Stack</strong> The runtime environment manages the <strong>event loop</strong>, which handles asynchronous code execution. The <strong>call stack</strong> tracks function calls and handles the execution order.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Global Object</strong> In a browser, this is typically the `window` object. In Node.js, the global object is `global`. It holds all globally accessible variables and functions.</li>

                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Browser Environment</strong> This is the most common runtime for JavaScript. Browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari provide the necessary runtime for executing JavaScript.
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><strong>Web APIs</strong> are available in the browser environment, such as `document`, `window`, `localStorage`, and more.</li>
                                                    <li>The <strong>DOM (Document Object Model)</strong> is also part of the runtime, allowing JavaScript to manipulate the HTML content of a web page.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Node.js Environment</strong> Node.js provides a JavaScript runtime for server-side development. It uses the <strong>V8 engine</strong> but provides additional built-in libraries for server tasks.
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>In Node.js, JavaScript can interact with the <strong>file system</strong>, <strong>networking</strong>, <strong>HTTP servers</strong>, <strong>streams</strong>, and other back-end capabilities.</li>
                                                    <li>Unlike browsers, Node.js doesn't have a DOM or Web APIs; instead, it has libraries like `fs` (file system), `http`, `url`, etc.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Deno</strong> Deno is a new runtime for JavaScript (and TypeScript) created by the original creator of Node.js, Ryan Dahl. It is designed with security, simplicity, and modern features in mind.</li>
